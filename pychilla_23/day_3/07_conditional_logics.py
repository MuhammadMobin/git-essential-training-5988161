# logical operators are either True or False or yes and no. or 0 &  1 

# greater then          >
# greater then or equal >=
# less then             >
# less then or equal    =<
# equal to              ==
# not equal             !=

# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>4)
# print(5>=4)
# print(5<=4)

# application of logical operator
# Hammad_age = 4
# school_age = 5
# # does hammad age is school going age
# print(Hammad_age == school_age) 

Hammad_age = input("Hammad age is: ")
school_age = 5
Hammad_age = int(Hammad_age)
print(Hammad_age>=school_age)
# print(f'Hammad can go to school as his age is {Hammad_age} \n
#       which is the greater then required minimum age to go to school {school_age}')

# difference between == and =
# == is used to compare values
# = is used to assign values
# example
# assignment operators =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=
# logical operators and, or, not
# comparison operators ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# identity operators is, is not
# membership operators in, not in
# bitwise operators &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
# examples of bitwise operators
