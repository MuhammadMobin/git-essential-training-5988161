# Troubleshooting in Python
# Troubleshooting is the process of diagnosing and resolving issues in code.
# Common errors in Python:
# 1. SyntaxError: This occurs when the code is not written correctly according to Python's syntax rules.
# 2. RuntimeError: This occurs when the code is syntactically correct but fails during execution.
# 3. NameError: This occurs when a variable or function is not defined.
# 4. TypeError: This occurs when an operation is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
# Example of troubleshooting in Python
# print("Hello World") #No error
# print(1+2) #No error
# # print("This is a programme in pythong ") #Typo in 'python' will not cause an error, but it's a mistake
# print("How old are you") #No error
    
# print('We are learning python.')
# print(25/0) #RuntimeError
print(25/5) #No error
name = "John"
print(f'Hello {name}') #No error
